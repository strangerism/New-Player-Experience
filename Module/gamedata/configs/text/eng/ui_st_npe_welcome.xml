		NPE framework is a tutorial system that aims to help new players to get started in the game. A Tutorial is the basic form of quest design for which this framework was created.
		\n
		\n
		Mods makers that add tutorials using the NPE framework will be able to use this system to guide new players through their content. 
		\n
		\n
		A deck of tutorials or simply deck, is a series of sets of cards (ui panels) that are displayed to player when specific conditions are met (contexts).
		\n
		\n
		For example, starting the game, opening a stash, looting an item, or talking to an NPC, etc.
		A deck can contain several sets about various topics.
		\n
		\n
		Each card or ui panel displays a title, text, and an image. A set normally consist of a max of three cards that are enough to explain something to you.
		The firt card usually presents the topic at hand, the second the explanation or action needed to be taken and the last card the conclusion or the results of the action.
		\n
		You can find more information about NPE on the mod page on the ModDb website.
